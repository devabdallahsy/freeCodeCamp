# Basic HTML Notes!

## What is HTML?
- It Stands for HyperText Markup Language.
- It's the code that defines the structure and content of a webpage. 
- It is made up of elements.
### example:
```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```
- It starts with an opening tag (`<h1>`), ends with a closing tag (`</h1>`), and has the text it will display in between the tags.
  - An `h1` element is the main heading of a webpage and you should only use one per page.
  - An `h2` elements represent subheadings.
### example:
```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<h2>My name is Abdallah</h2>
```
- There are six heading elements in HTML: 
  - `h1` through `h6`.
- They're used to show the importance of sections on your webpage, with `h1` being the most important and `h6` the least.
- The `p` element is used to add a paragraph to a webpage.
### example:
```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<h2>My name is Abdallah.</h2>
